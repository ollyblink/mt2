SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ARE ENCLOSED IN QUOTES, SO TYPE WHAT YOU SEE.

START OFF BY GOING "N".  YOU ARE NOW STANDING AT THE END OF A ROAD BEFORE A
SMALL BRICK BUILDING.  THIS BUILDING IS THE WELLHOUSE, AND IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF THE GAME.  THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME IS TO GET THE 15 TREASURES BACK TO THE
WELLHOUSE.

CONTINUE WITH "IN", AND YOU ARE INSIDE THE WELL HOUSE, SO "GET FOOD", "GET
LAMP", "GET KEYS", "GET BOTTLE".  NOW, THERE ARE THREE MAGIC WORDS YOU NEED TO
USE.  THEY ARE PLUGH, XYZZY AND PLOVER.  TWO OF THESE WORDS ARE USED TO GET TO
AND FROM THE WELLHOUSE AND PARTS OF THE CAVE.  THE THIRD, PLOVER IS USED TO GET
BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF THE CAVE.	ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOUR LAMP
LIGHT IS LIMITED, SO TURN OFF YOUR LAMP WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED IT!

NOW ON TO THE CAVE.  SAY "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET SILVER", "DROP
KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "DROP BOTTLE", "N".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT Y2.  HERE IS WHERE
YOU USE PLOVER.  SO SAY "PLOVER", THEN "NE", "GET PYRAMID", "S", "LAMP OFF",
"DROP LAMP", "DROP SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID", "GET EMERALD", "W", "DROP EMERALD",
"BACK".  THE REASON YOU DID ALL OF THAT WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE
EMERALD OUT OF THE PLOVER ROOM IS OUT THROUGH THE CRACK, BUT YOU CAN NOT CARRY
ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOU.

NOW "GET LAMP", "GET SILVER", "GET PYRAMID", THEN "PLOVER" AND "PLUGH".  YOU
ARE NOW BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP OFF YOUR TREASURES SO FAR.  TYPE "DROP
SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID".  BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "XYZZY", AND "LAMP ON", "E",
"GET CAGE", "W", "GET ROD", "W", "W","DROP ROD", "GET BIRD", "GET ROD", "W",
"D","W", "WAVE ROD".  THERE IS NOW A CRYSTAL BRIDGE ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE
WITH "DROP ROD", THEN GO "W", "GET DIAMONDS", "E", "E", "S", "GET GOLD", "N",
"D".  AT THIS POINT YOU WILL SEE A HUGE GREEN SNAKE BARING YOUR WAY.  TO BE RID
OF THE SNAKE, "DROP BIRD", AND THE SNAKE IS DRIVEN AWAY.

AT THIS POINT I NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE DWARF, THROW THE AXE AT HIM TO KILL HIM.	THIS MAY HAPPEN
SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.


NOW COMES THE EASY PART, JUST WANDER AROUND THESE PASSAGES, AS YOU NOW HAVE
SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE
ROOM.  NOW YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORD - "BLAST".  YOU HAVE NOW EXPLODED A HOLE IN
THE FAR WALL, AND YOU MARCH THROUGH IT INTO THE MAIN OFFICE.  YOU HAVE NOW
FINISHED THE GAME OF ADVENTURE!

SMALL BRICK BUILDING.  THIS BUILDING IS THE WELLHOUSE, AND IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF THE GAME.  THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME IS TO GET THE 15 TREASURES BACK TO THE
WELLHOUSE.

CONTINUE WITH "IN", AND YOU ARE INSIDE THE WELL HOUSE, SO "GET FOOD", "GET
LAMP", "GET KEYS", "GET BOTTLE".  NOW, THERE ARE THREE MAGIC WORDS YOU NEED TO
USE.  THEY ARE PLUGH, XYZZY AND PLOVER.  TWO OF THESE WORDS ARE USED TO GET TO
AND FROM THE WELLHOUSE AND PARTS OF THE CAVE.  THE THIRD, PLOVER IS USED TO GET
BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF THE CAVE.	ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOUR LAMP
LIGHT IS LIMITED, SO TURN OFF YOUR LAMP WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED IT!

NOW ON TO THE CAVE.  SAY "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET SILVER", "DROP
KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "DROP BOTTLE", "N".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT Y2.  HERE IS WHERE
YOU USE PLOVER.  SO SAY "PLOVER", THEN "NE", "GET PYRAMID", "S", "LAMP OFF",
"DROP LAMP", "DROP SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID", "GET EMERALD", "W", "DROP EMERALD",
"BACK".  THE REASON YOU DID ALL OF THAT WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE
EMERALD OUT OF THE PLOVER ROOM IS OUT THROUGH THE CRACK, BUT YOU CAN NOT CARRY
ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOU.

NOW "GET LAMP", "GET SILVER", "GET PYRAMID", THEN "PLOVER" AND "PLUGH".  YOU
ARE NOW BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP OFF YOUR TREASURES SO FAR.  TYPE "DROP
SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID".  BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "XYZZY", AND "LAMP ON", "E",
"GET CAGE", "W", "GET ROD", "W", "W","DROP ROD", "GET BIRD", "GET ROD", "W",
"D","W", "WAVE ROD".  THERE IS NOW A CRYSTAL BRIDGE ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE
WITH "DROP ROD", THEN GO "W", "GET DIAMONDS", "E", "E", "S", "GET GOLD", "N",
"D".  AT THIS POINT YOU WILL SEE A HUGE GREEN SNAKE BARING YOUR WAY.  TO BE RID
OF THE SNAKE, "DROP BIRD", AND THE SNAKE IS DRIVEN AWAY.

AT THIS POINT I NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE DWARF, THROW THE AXE AT HIM TO KILL HIM.	THIS MAY HAPPEN
SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.


NOW COMES THE EASY PART, JUST WANDER AROUND THESE PASSAGES, AS YOU NOW HAVE
SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE
ROOM.  NOW YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORD - "BLAST".  YOU HAVE NOW EXPLODED A HOLE IN
THE FAR WALL, AND YOU MARCH THROUGH IT INTO THE MAIN OFFICE.  YOU HAVE NOW
FINISHED THE GAME OF ADVENTURE!

OF THE GAME.  THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME IS TO GET THE 15 TREASURES BACK TO THE
WELLHOUSE.

CONTINUE WITH "IN", AND YOU ARE INSIDE THE WELL HOUSE, SO "GET FOOD", "GET
LAMP", "GET KEYS", "GET BOTTLE".  NOW, THERE ARE THREE MAGIC WORDS YOU NEED TO
USE.  THEY ARE PLUGH, XYZZY AND PLOVER.  TWO OF THESE WORDS ARE USED TO GET TO
AND FROM THE WELLHOUSE AND PARTS OF THE CAVE.  THE THIRD, PLOVER IS USED TO GET
BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF THE CAVE.	ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOUR LAMP
LIGHT IS LIMITED, SO TURN OFF YOUR LAMP WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED IT!

NOW ON TO THE CAVE.  SAY "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET SILVER", "DROP
KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "DROP BOTTLE", "N".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT Y2.  HERE IS WHERE
YOU USE PLOVER.  SO SAY "PLOVER", THEN "NE", "GET PYRAMID", "S", "LAMP OFF",
"DROP LAMP", "DROP SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID", "GET EMERALD", "W", "DROP EMERALD",
"BACK".  THE REASON YOU DID ALL OF THAT WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE
EMERALD OUT OF THE PLOVER ROOM IS OUT THROUGH THE CRACK, BUT YOU CAN NOT CARRY
ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOU.

NOW "GET LAMP", "GET SILVER", "GET PYRAMID", THEN "PLOVER" AND "PLUGH".  YOU
ARE NOW BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP OFF YOUR TREASURES SO FAR.  TYPE "DROP
SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID".  BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "XYZZY", AND "LAMP ON", "E",
"GET CAGE", "W", "GET ROD", "W", "W","DROP ROD", "GET BIRD", "GET ROD", "W",
"D","W", "WAVE ROD".  THERE IS NOW A CRYSTAL BRIDGE ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE
WITH "DROP ROD", THEN GO "W", "GET DIAMONDS", "E", "E", "S", "GET GOLD", "N",
"D".  AT THIS POINT YOU WILL SEE A HUGE GREEN SNAKE BARING YOUR WAY.  TO BE RID
OF THE SNAKE, "DROP BIRD", AND THE SNAKE IS DRIVEN AWAY.

AT THIS POINT I NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE DWARF, THROW THE AXE AT HIM TO KILL HIM.	THIS MAY HAPPEN
SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.


NOW COMES THE EASY PART, JUST WANDER AROUND THESE PASSAGES, AS YOU NOW HAVE
SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE
ROOM.  NOW YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORD - "BLAST".  YOU HAVE NOW EXPLODED A HOLE IN
THE FAR WALL, AND YOU MARCH THROUGH IT INTO THE MAIN OFFICE.  YOU HAVE NOW
FINISHED THE GAME OF ADVENTURE!

CONTINUE WITH "IN", AND YOU ARE INSIDE THE WELL HOUSE, SO "GET FOOD", "GET
LAMP", "GET KEYS", "GET BOTTLE".  NOW, THERE ARE THREE MAGIC WORDS YOU NEED TO
USE.  THEY ARE PLUGH, XYZZY AND PLOVER.  TWO OF THESE WORDS ARE USED TO GET TO
AND FROM THE WELLHOUSE AND PARTS OF THE CAVE.  THE THIRD, PLOVER IS USED TO GET
BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF THE CAVE.	ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOUR LAMP
LIGHT IS LIMITED, SO TURN OFF YOUR LAMP WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED IT!

NOW ON TO THE CAVE.  SAY "PLUGH", THEN "LAMP ON", "S", "GET SILVER", "DROP
KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "DROP BOTTLE", "N".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT Y2.  HERE IS WHERE
YOU USE PLOVER.  SO SAY "PLOVER", THEN "NE", "GET PYRAMID", "S", "LAMP OFF",
"DROP LAMP", "DROP SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID", "GET EMERALD", "W", "DROP EMERALD",
"BACK".  THE REASON YOU DID ALL OF THAT WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE
EMERALD OUT OF THE PLOVER ROOM IS OUT THROUGH THE CRACK, BUT YOU CAN NOT CARRY
ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOU.

NOW "GET LAMP", "GET SILVER", "GET PYRAMID", THEN "PLOVER" AND "PLUGH".  YOU
ARE NOW BACK IN THE WELLHOUSE, SO DROP OFF YOUR TREASURES SO FAR.  TYPE "DROP
SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID".  BACK TO THE CAVE WITH "XYZZY", AND "LAMP ON", "E",

"D","W", "WAVE ROD".  THERE IS NOW A CRYSTAL BRIDGE ACROSS THE CHASM.  CONTINUE
WITH "DROP ROD", THEN GO "W", "GET DIAMONDS", "E", "E", "S", "GET GOLD", "N",
"D".  AT THIS POINT YOU WILL SEE A HUGE GREEN SNAKE BARING YOUR WAY.  TO BE RID
OF THE SNAKE, "DROP BIRD", AND THE SNAKE IS DRIVEN AWAY.

AT THIS POINT I NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE DWARF, THROW THE AXE AT HIM TO KILL HIM.	THIS MAY HAPPEN
SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.


NOW COMES THE EASY PART, JUST WANDER AROUND THESE PASSAGES, AS YOU NOW HAVE
SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE
ROOM.  NOW YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORD - "BLAST".  YOU HAVE NOW EXPLODED A HOLE IN
THE FAR WALL, AND YOU MARCH THROUGH IT INTO THE MAIN OFFICE.  YOU HAVE NOW
FINISHED THE GAME OF ADVENTURE!

GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE

AND FROM THE WELLHOUSE AND PARTS OF THE CAVE.  THE THIRD, PLOVER IS USED TO GET
BETWEEN TWO PARTS OF THE CAVE.	ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOUR LAMP
LIGHT IS LIMITED, SO TURN OFF YOUR LAMP WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED IT!

KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "DROP BOTTLE", "N".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT Y2.  HERE IS WHERE
YOU USE PLOVER.  SO SAY "PLOVER", THEN "NE", "GET PYRAMID", "S", "LAMP OFF",
"DROP LAMP", "DROP SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID", "GET EMERALD", "W", "DROP EMERALD",
"BACK".  THE REASON YOU DID ALL OF THAT WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE
EMERALD OUT OF THE PLOVER ROOM IS OUT THROUGH THE CRACK, BUT YOU CAN NOT CARRY
ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOU.

OF THE SNAKE, "DROP BIRD", AND THE SNAKE IS DRIVEN AWAY.

AT THIS POINT I NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE DWARF, THROW THE AXE AT HIM TO KILL HIM.	THIS MAY HAPPEN
SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.


NOW COMES THE EASY PART, JUST WANDER AROUND THESE PASSAGES, AS YOU NOW HAVE
SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE
ROOM.  NOW YOU SAY THE MAGIC WORD - "BLAST".  YOU HAVE NOW EXPLODED A HOLE IN
THE FAR WALL, AND YOU MARCH THROUGH IT INTO THE MAIN OFFICE.  YOU HAVE NOW

LIGHT IS LIMITED, SO TURN OFF YOUR LAMP WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED IT!

KEYS", "DROP FOOD", "DROP BOTTLE", "N".  YOU ARE NOW BACK AT Y2.  HERE IS WHERE
YOU USE PLOVER.  SO SAY "PLOVER", THEN "NE", "GET PYRAMID", "S", "LAMP OFF",
"DROP LAMP", "DROP SILVER", "DROP PYRAMID", "GET EMERALD", "W", "DROP EMERALD",
"BACK".  THE REASON YOU DID ALL OF THAT WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE

OF THE SNAKE, "DROP BIRD", AND THE SNAKE IS DRIVEN AWAY.

AT THIS POINT I NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE
GAME, A DWARF WILL SEEK YOU OUT AND THROW AN AXE AT YOU.  GET THE AXE.	THE
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE DWARF, THROW THE AXE AT HIM TO KILL HIM.	THIS MAY HAPPEN
SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.


NOW COMES THE EASY PART, JUST WANDER AROUND THESE PASSAGES, AS YOU NOW HAVE
SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS PLACED A STICK OF DYNAMITE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".

SEVERAL TIMES, SO JUST KEEP KILLING THE DWARVES.  ANOTHER PERSON TO WATCH OUT
FOR IS THE PIRATE.  HE WILL SHOW UP AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME, AND STEAL
WHATEVER TREASURES YOU ARE CARRYING.  IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN GET THE
TREASURES BACK WHEN YOU FIND HIS TREASURE CHEST.

SOME TIME TO KILL.  THE GAME GIVES YOU A SET NUMBER A MOVES AFTER ALL THE
TREASURES ARE IN THE WELLHOUSE, AND THEN YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE GRAND
FINALE.  THE MESSAGE YOU WILL GET WILL START BY SAYING "THE CAVE IS NOW
CLOSED", ECT.  AT THIS POINT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE NORTHEAST END OF AN
IMMENSE ROOM.  DO THE FOLLOWING:  "SW", "GET ROD", "NE", "DROP ROD", "SW".
